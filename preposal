# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Sudoku

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will make a sudoku solver that solves a sudoku puzzle

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will have to make an interface of the sudoku screen and loop through the numbers to solve in the missing spaces. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

It will solves a sudoku puzzle

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It can make a sudoku game and solve it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have a sudoku game that will produce a interface will sudoku and it can be played by a user or solved by the program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need know how to loop through numbers and produce an interface of the sudoku puzzle.
